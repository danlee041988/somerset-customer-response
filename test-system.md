### 1. Window Cleaning Inquiry

Hi there,

I'm looking to get my windows cleaned at my house in Keynsham. I have a 3-bedroom semi-detached house with quite a few windows. Could you let me know your prices and when you might be available?

Thanks,
Sarah Johnson

Hello,

We run a small office building in Bath city center with about 15 windows that need regular cleaning. We're looking for a monthly service. Could you provide a quote and let us know your availability for commercial contracts?

Best regards,
