Window Cleaning:
- 4-weekly service (PREFERRED - better revenue)

Gutter Services - IMPORTANT: Two different services:
1. GUTTER CLEARING - Internal parts of gutters only
2. GUTTER AND FASCIA CLEANING - External parts of gutters, fascia, and soffit cleaning

CRITICAL: When customer mentions "gutter cleaning" - ALWAYS clarify which service they require as they are completely different services with different pricing.

Internal Window Cleaning:
- Try NOT to offer internal window cleaning
- Only offer if customer specifically requests it
- Can be done on customer request`,
